Jenkins 
=============
Jenkins is an open-source continuous integration software tool written in the Java programming language for testing and reporting on isolated changes in a larger code base in real time. The software enables developers to find and solve defects in a code base rapidly and to automate testing of their builds.


step1:
-------
	Download and Install JDK 11 for Jenkins.
	ex:
		https://www.codejava.net/java-se/download-and-install-java-11-openjdk-and-oracle-jdk

	

step2:
--------
	Download the Jenkins.
	ex:
		https://www.jenkins.io/download/

step3:
-------
	Install the jenkins for windows OS.
	ex:
		Double click to Jenkins softwawre --> next --> next --> select on
		"Run service as LocalSystem" --> next --> port no: 8181--> 
		click on "Test port" --> next--> 
		Select java JDK location (C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11\) --> Next
		---> Next --> Install --> Yes (popup) --> Finish. 
	
	
step4:
-----
	Now types below request url in browser address bar to start the jenkins.
	ex:
		http://localhost:8181

step5:
-----
	Now copy and paste below directory in c drive and click on open with notepad.
	
	ex:
		C:\ProgramData\Jenkins\.jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword


		password : 753802253a2648a6af59d2cb089c3de5 --> continue -->
		select install suggested plugin --> click on continue -->

		username : jenkins
		password : jenkins143786
		confirm password : jenkins143786
		fullname : jenkins
		email : niyazulhasan61@gmail.com ---> save and continue -->
		starts using jenkins.


step6:
-----
	Click to create a job in jenkins.
	
	Enter the item name : IH-JAVA-015  ---> select free style project -->
	->ok  --> description:  simple jenkins demostration  --> Build steps -->
	Execution windows batch command : java -version
                                          dir 
	--> save .



step7:
------
	Build the job.
	ex:	
		click on build now.
